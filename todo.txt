-- consideration

1: create IReduxModule interface that classes implement, that has methods like
`getActionCreators`, `getReducers` etc. ?

2: should classes implement IReduxModule? or should they have a separate class
(ie. <class_name>ReduxModule.ts) that implements IReduxModule and handles
actions / thunks /reducers ?

3: get rid of `auth` in Firebase, move it into Auth class, abstract Firebase
away from it (so we have the ability to replace the authentication system easily
in the future)
